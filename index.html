            <h1 class="title">Hi, I'm Frank</h1>
            <p>Nice to meet you.</p>
            <p>Underwood is from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaffney,_South_Carolina">Gaffney, South Carolina</a>. He graduated from The Sentinel (a fictionalized version of The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina) in 1980 and, subsequently, Harvard Law School in 1984.</p>
            <p>Some of Underwood's dialogue throughout the series is presented in a direct address to the audience, a narrative technique that breaks the fourth wall. The character speaks with a Southern accent. During season 1, he is the Democratic Majority Whip in the United States House of Representatives. In season 2, he is the newly appointed Vice President of the United States, before becoming President of the United States in the season finale.</p>
            <p>Underwood has been described as conniving, Machiavellian, sociopathic, and a symbol of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption">political corruption</a>. Throughout the series, he manipulates and destroys several people, including those he calls friends, for his own ends</p>
            <h4 class="Early Life">Early life</h4>
            <p>Francis J. Underwood was born on November 5, 1959, to Catherine and Calvin T. Underwood in Gaffney, South Carolina. He is an only child.[8] He was raised in impoverished circumstances, with the threat of bank foreclosure on the farm they lived on. He entered The Sentinel, a military school in Charleston, South Carolina, loosely based on The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina, in the fall of 1976.</p>
            <p>He graduated in 1980 and, despite having made poor grades, gained admittance into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Law_School">Harvard Law School</a>. He received his J.D. degree from there in 1984.[8][9][10] While at the Sentinel, he had a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality">homosexual</a> relationship with his roommate, Tim Corbet (David Andrews), which lasted until his first year of law school. Underwood was raised Christian and publicly pays lip service to religious faith, but privately holds God in complete contempt</p>
            <h4 class="Family">Family</h4>
            <p>Underwood's great-great-great-grandfather, Corporal Augustus Elijah Underwood, was a Confederate soldier who served in the 12th South Carolina Infantry Regiment of Samuel McGowan's Brigade at the Battle of Spotsylvania. He served at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Spotsylvania_Court_House#May_12:_The_Bloody_Angle">Bloody Angle</a> on May 12, 1864, during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War">Civil War</a> and was killed by a bludgeon to the back of the head from his own regiment during the middle of the night. Underwood is fascinated by his ancestry, even though he dismisses the Confederacy as "weak" and their cause of preserving slavery "asinine". When Underwood falls into a coma following an assassination attempt, Augustus appears in several of his hallucinations. His great-great grandfather was two when Augustus was killed.</p>
            <p>His father, Calvin T. Underwood, was a peach farmer in his home town of Gaffney who died at the age of 43 of a heart attack. The Underwoods lived in poverty, and nearly lost the farm when Frank was a child; to get a bank loan and avoid foreclosure, his father attended a meeting of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a>, of which the bank manager was a member. Underwood speaks fondly of his father in public,[13] but this is a political ploy; in his asides to the audience, Underwood describes his father as a weak man who accomplished nothing with his life.[14] He even urinates on his father's grave in season 3. Despite disliking his father, however, Underwood was influenced by him.[15] Calvin was an abusive alcoholic and caused his wife and son years of misery.</p>
            <p>Underwood has said that when he was 13, he walked in on his father putting a shotgun in his mouth. Calvin asked him to pull the trigger, which he refused to do. He has stated that his biggest regret is not killing his father when he had the chance.</p>
            <h4 class="Politic">Political career</h4>
            <h5>South Carolina Legislature</h5>
            <p> Underwood was elected at the age of 25 to the South Carolina State Senate as one of the youngest members in the state's legislative history after graduating from Harvard in 1984. He was re-elected to the state senate at 29 in 1988 for his second, and last, term as a State <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate">Senator</a></p>
            <h5>Congressional Election</h5>
            <p>Underwood was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1990 as a Democratic representative for the 5th Congressional District of South Carolina, being sworn in during January 1991. He won another 11 consecutive elections, winning his final term in 2012.
